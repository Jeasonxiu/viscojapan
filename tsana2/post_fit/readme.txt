Use proper model to fit postseismic time series.

Inputs: time series with linear trend substracted
Outputs: Observed co- and post-seismic displacements, which are served as inputs for modeling.

Specific tasks in this directory:
(1) Decide which stations shoulb be used for postseismic time series modeling.
These stations will finnaly be used in postseismic deformation modeling.

(2) Do postseismic modeling

(3) Generate co- and post-seismic displacement observation at epoches.

(4) Check results, e.g. misfits.
