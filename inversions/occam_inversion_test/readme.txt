This dir tests occam algorithm on static inversion for non linear parameter rake.
The true model is simulated using rake=80.

The first iteration using rake=90 as the initial value. 
The initial slip input for the first iteration is obtained in 
the directory "initial_slip".

After three iterations, I get rake ~= 80.
