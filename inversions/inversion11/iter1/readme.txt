Iter1:

The last iteration models are:
Model0:
visM = 6.3E18 Pa.sec
He = 50 km
rake = 83

Model1:
visM = 9.5E18 Pa.sec
He = 50 km
rake = 83

Model2:
visM = 6.3E18 Pa.sec
He = 60 km
rake = 83

Model3:
visM = 6.3E18 Pa.sec
He = 50 km
rake = 90

The inferred model is:
visM = 8.459897E18 Pa.sec
He = 47.17 km
rake = 83.98
