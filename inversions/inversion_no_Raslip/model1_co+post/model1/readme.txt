run1:

This is an no-Raslip model. Its main characteristics are:
(1) Coseismic slip and postseimic slip are not separated. They are handled together.
(2) Coseismic slip result is actually affected by not only coseismic displacements,
but also postseismic displacements.
(3) The only difference between this inversion and the coupled inversion is the way
by which the Gs are stacked.
