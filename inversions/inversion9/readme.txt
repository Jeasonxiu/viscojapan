In this inversion:
1. Use wider fault model that I used in coseismic slip inversion,
 regardless of the elastic depth.
2. Combine coseismic and postseismic displacement;
3. Use smaller SD (larger weighting) for coseismic observation;
4. Horizontal SD : Vertical SD = 1:5
5. Use near field stations only.
