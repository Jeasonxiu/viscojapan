Initial iteration.
The result is a little surprising to me.

1. The rake is about 74 degree, which is smaller than previous result 81, obtained
through postseismic inversion.

2. The result looks very good, in the sense that no boundary conditions needed.

3. This run uses an initial slip that is from previous inversion. 
Next run will try to use an initial slip that based on this run.
