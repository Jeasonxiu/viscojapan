iter0
This inversion uses wider fault plane (dep>80km) for better afterslip inversion.

iter1
Actually, I don't need that wider fault, so in this iteration, I use narrower
fault (dep<=80)

iter2
Compute longer dates.

iter3
Model0:
visM = 8.9E18
He = 46
rake = 84

Model1:
visM = 9.9E18
He = 46
rake = 84.01

Model2:
visM = 8.9E18
He = 50
rake = 84

Model3:
visM = 8.9E18
He = 46
rake = 85
