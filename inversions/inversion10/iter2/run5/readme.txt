The old regularization method:
1. Coseismic slip - 2nd order
2. Afterslip - 0th order

Aterslip need to be smooth, too.
Change to the following regularization method:
2nd order for all
and 0zth order for afterslip.

Use BasisMatrixBSpline as basis function.

=============================
run 5
Use sites_Yamagiwa to do inversion use only near field stations.
My near-field RMS is large compare to Yamagiwa's result, where he uses only
near-field stations.
