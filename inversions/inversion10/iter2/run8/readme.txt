Run3
The old regularization method:
1. Coseismic slip - 2nd order
2. Afterslip - 0th order

Aterslip need to be smooth, too.
Change to the following regularization method:
2nd order for all
and 0zth order for afterslip.

Use BasisMatrixBSpline as basis function.

Run 8
Based on Run3.
In this version, make sure that the initial value of slip (Bm) is given, 
no the m.
