My inverted moment is too large. And my inverted slip looks very different
from Pollitz. I am trying to fix this problem. (See research notes [20140918])

I thought it might be because the grid i am using is too raw (subfault size: 20*20km). So in this test, 
I am using a much denser grids (7*7km).

Conclusion:
Preliminary result suggests that it is not the problem of density of subfault grids.

Next susbicious cause is that the way I am setting slip parameters is wrong.
As Pollitz mentioned in his paper (Pollitz 1996), the input should be set in this way:
the width of each subfault should be set to infinitesimally small, 
and the potent is kept the same by using larger slip.
