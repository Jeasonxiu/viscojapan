This earthquake was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded to \r\n\thave hit Japan and causes extensive co- and post-seismic deformation, which\r\n\tis recorded by more than one thousands GPS stations in and around Japan.\r\n\r\n\tThis software package is designed for the analyze of GPS time series that are related with\r\n\tthis earthquake and do the linear and non-linear modeling to infer earthquake \r\n\tparameters and the rheological parameters of the Earth.\r\n\r\n##\tLanguages used\r\n\r\n* \tPython3 : Python is the main language used to write this package.\r\n* \tR\t \t  : R is integrated with Python to do linear regression analysis of \r\n\t\t\t\tGPS time series.\r\n* \tC/C++   : Some parts of Python are written with C/C++ to enhance \r\n\t\t\t\tperformance.\r\n\r\n## Third-party Python libraries required\r\n\r\n* \tnumpy : for scientific computation\r\n* \tscipy : for scientific computation\r\n* \tmatplotlib : for 2D plotting\r\n* \tbasemap : for 2D geographic plotting\r\n* \trpy2 : R python wrapper\r\n* \th5py : For results storage and efficient large data accessing\r\n* \tcvxopt : Python library for convex optimization\r\n* \tpyproj : Performs cartographic transformations and geodetic computations\r\n* \tsimplekml : generate kml (or kmz) for displaying data on google map/earth\r\n\t\r\n\r\n##\tAuthor\r\n\r\n\tYang Zhang (zy31415@gmail.com)\r\n\tUniversity of Nevada, Reno\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
