This earthquake was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded to \r\n\thave hit Japan and causes extensive co- and post-seismic deformation, which\r\n\tis recorded by more than one thousands GPS stations in and around Japan.\r\n\r\n\tThis software package is designed for the analyze of GPS time series that are related with\r\n\tthis earthquake and do the linear and non-linear modeling to infer earthquake \r\n\tparameters and the rheological parameters of the Earth. Specifically, this\r\n\tpackage contains the following parts:\r\n\t\t1) GPS time series management (sqlite3 database);  \r\n\t\t2) GPS time series modeling­ - Linear modeling of pre­seismic GPS time series;  \r\n\t\t3) GPS time series modeling - Nonlinear inversion of co­seismic slip and afterslip (solve for more than 10, 000 parameters);\t\t\t\r\n\t\t4) Results analysis and report.  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Package structure\r\n\tAll libraries developed for the project can be found under lib/ directory.\r\n\tAll the unit tests of these libraries are under test/.\r\n\tOther directories are for specific experiments or tasks.\r\n\r\n## Libraries\r\n\tAll libraries developed for this project can be found under lib/ directory.\r\n\r\n### viscojapan : lib/viscojapan/­ \r\n\tAll the linear and nonlinear analysis are implemented in this library.\r\n\t\r\n*\tlib/viscojapan/tsana/\t\r\n\tLinear analysis ­R wrapper for linear regression analysis.\r\n\r\n*\tlib/viscojapan/\r\n\tNonlinear analysis – The core is the method of convex optimization \r\n\tprovided by an open source Python package called cvxopt.
