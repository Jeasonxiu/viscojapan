My inverted moment is too large. And my inverted slip looks very different
from Pollitz. I am trying to fix this problem. (See research notes [20140918])

In this test, the susbicious cause is that the way I am setting slip parameters is wrong.
As Pollitz mentioned in his paper (Pollitz 1996), the input should be set in this way:
the width of each subfault should be set to infinitesimally small, 
and the potent is kept the same by using larger slip.
